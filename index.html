                  I currently work with Professor Wang Jiangtao on mobile crowdsourcing.
                  The project goal is to develop an efficient, low-cost participant selection framework which minimizes incentive payments
                  by selecting a small number of participants while still satisfying probabilistic coverage
                  constraint.

                  I am currently working as a data analyst intern at World Resource Institute.
                  My first task as an intern was to use data to visualize China's water resources and then to create a website to display it.
                  Then I'm trying to answerthe pivotal question – what is the main cause of the water shortages in China
                  and what can be done in the future to alleviate them?

                  My work in Columbia mainly focused on identifying behavior differences
                  between popular and unpopular social media users. I
                  extracted features according to community rules of becoming popular and performed data analysis
                  with sklearn. I discovered that community rules promoting content creation +
                  exposure on other websites correlated with popularity growth.

                        <p>
                          Nowadays, there is an increasing demand to provide real-time environmental
                          information such as air quality, noise level, traffic condition, etc.
                          to citizens in urban areas.
                          The proliferation of sensor-equipped smartphones and the mobility
                          of people are making Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS)
                          an effective way to sense and collect information at a low deployment cost.
                          In MCS, instead of deploying static sensors in urban areas,
                          people with mobile devices play the role of mobile sensors
                          to sense the information of their surroundings and
                          the cellular network is used to transfer data for MCS applications.
                          In order to minizie incentive payment for mobile users,
                          we first predicts the coverage probability of each mobile user based on historical records.
                          Then we efficiently compute the joint coverage probability of multiple users as a combined set and
                          selects the near-minimal set of participants.

                        <p>
                          Studies show that 30% of the land in China suffers from lack of water,
                          which is defined as the total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural)
                          over the total annual available surface water. Based on GDP, water use etc. data,
                          we dirst calculated the supply and demand of water in different areas, based on which
                          we used a score to indicate the water pressure. The brighter the color in the picture left,
                          the higher water pressure that area has.The we want to dig out the reason of the distribution of pressure.
                          Our research questions include what's the most important factor of water shortage? Is urbanization the main
                          cause of environmental deterioration ? What kind of policy can balance economic development and environmental health?

                        <p>
                          Out of curiosity, we want to know the differences between
                          popular and unpopular users online.To the best of our knowledge,
                          this is the first quantitative study of how user behavior affects
                          user popularity on social media services.In particular, we studied Twitch,
                          which represents an increasingly popular class of video broadcasting services.
                          By connecting streamers’ behavior on social media platforms, we found that many of the
                          predictive features are related to ways that increase the reach of the streamer, including
                          proactively advertising on popular social media networks (e.g., Twitter),
                          archiving past broadcasts so that they can be viewed later on, broadcasting with a predictable schedule, and playing a variety of different games plays a significant role in getting attention. Surprisingly, video content itself is not that predictive. We hope that the suggestions we made from analyzing data can
                          help hopeful streamers grow a larger fanbase and become popular.

                        <p>
                          With the development of mobile Internet, social network is
                          becoming more and more popular. A special kind of social
                          network—location-based social networks (LBSNs),
                          such as Gowalla, Foursquare, and Wechat have emerged in recent years.
                          Compared with other social networks, location-based social networks (LBSN s)
                          also consider the geographic factors.
                          As the number of POIs increases dramatically in LBSNs, the POI recommendation plays an important role in
                          helping users discover new spots as well as helping the third-parties provide better
                          services. We tried collaborative filtering and a fully connected neural network by encoding users’ behaviors into one-hot
                          feature.However, the result was not satisfying.Finally, we changed to a logistic regression model,
                          which was much faster and more accurate. However, we still need more work in this area,
                          including figuring out a clever way to encode space information and an efficient way to deal with time series data.

                        <h3>Deadline visualization</h3>
                        <p>
                          With other three team members, I developed an Android App related to deadline
                          visualization to improve users’ efficiency in individual business management.
                          We used 'bubbles' to represent each ddl. The size and color of each bubbles are related
                          to the event's urgency, importance etc. We also designed algorithm to ensure the nice
                          arrangement of each bubble. This is an Hackthon project and we got ‘Application of the Most
                          Market Potential Award’ and ‘Best Education Award’ from Jisuanke, Umeng etc.

                        <h3>Pagespeed Insights related</h3>
                        <p>
                          This is part of my tasks during my internship in Google.
                          We took advantage of nodes to represent various resources on websites.
                          The directed edges between nodes represent the dependencies.
                          We want to get web quality info from the dependency graph.
                          The most popular visualization library for node graphs is D3 gravity graph. However, each
                          node takes several seconds to get its final position becuase the algorithm needs to iterate
                          many times. In order to improve user experience, I gave up D3 and designed a simple algorithm that need
                          not iterate and improve the speed of rendering nodes. Morever, the algorithm avoid overlappings between nodes.

                        <h3>Algorithm Design for Reversi Competition</h3>
                        <p>
                          I worked with other five team members to design a reversi
                          algorithm in a course competition. We tried to figure out an
                          efficient recursion method to provide a solution to competing with other teams.
                          The core algorithm lies in figuring how to delete useless points to elimiate complexity of
                          recursive search. By communicating with professional chess played and combining cs technology,
                          finally my team ranked top8 among 50 teams.
